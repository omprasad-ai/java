1.Diff between primitive and Non primitive Datatype

A Predefined vs. User-defined:
Primitive types are predefined; non-primitive types are user-defined (or part of Java's standard library classes).
Value vs. Reference:
Primitive types store actual values; non-primitive types store references to objects.
Nullability:
Primitive types cannot be null; non-primitive types can be null.
Methods:
Primitive types do not have methods; non-primitive types can call methods to perform operations.
Memory Allocation:
Primitive values are typically stored on the stack; non-primitive objects are stored on the heap.
